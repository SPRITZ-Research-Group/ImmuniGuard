        In order to comply with those requirements, the iBeacon Bluetooth low energy advertise
        data packet format is removed from this source code.

        The code may still contains some strings or data format referring to it (e.g. UUID,
        major, and minor numbers) since there are part of public interfaces and knowledge
        for developers.
