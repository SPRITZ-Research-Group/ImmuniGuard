 * modules that communicate with Beacon Simulator solely through the                    *
 * net.alea.beaconsimulator.bluetooth.AdvertiseDataGenerator and the                    *
 * net.alea.beaconsimulator.bluetooth.AdvertiseDataParser interfaces. You may           *

 * Beacon Simulator and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided that         *

 * The intent of this license exception and interface is to allow Bluetooth low energy  *
